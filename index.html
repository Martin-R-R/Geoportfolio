      <h2>My Current Pursuits</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Martin, I'm 22 and grew up in South-West Victoria. I'm currently based in Geelong where I work for SMEC while completing my final year of study at RMIT. Through RMIT I am also collaborating with Google for my honours research project this year.  </p>

        <h3>My Research Project</h3>
        <p>I have spent this year working on my honours with Google exploring possible indoor navigation innovations using Cloud Anchors. I have been developing an indoor navigation application in Unity to help navigate the RMIT library to locate books. The app uses the android phone camera to place virtual 'anchors' in augmented reality that are stored in the cloud to be resolved later. Once we build a network of cloud anchors throughout the library we are able to resolve them with arrowed directions displayed over the phone camera to lead the user towards their destination. </p>

        <h3>My Work</h3>
        <p>I have worked in the surveying industry for 2 years. I began by working for a small family surveying and town planning business in Colac and now work for the engineering company SMEC at their Geelong office. I am currently working casually at SMEC but will move into fulltime in 2023 and begin the process to become a licenced surveyor. </p>
